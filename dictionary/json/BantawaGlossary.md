# Bantawa Glossary

This glossary was automatically extracted from [ToolBox](https://software.sil.org/toolbox/) files using a Java program.
The [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library was used to serialize it to Json.

The format should be pretty self-explanatory; try to understand before you ask -
but by all means, ask if you find you cannot understand the format.

Usage is for all - this data is free - but as per the [readme file](../../README.md) please be nice.
Comments and corrections are welcome!

Enjoy!
