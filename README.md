Bantawa Language Data

This repository contains data originating from (possibly) multiple sources.
So far, all of this data is Bantawa language data that I collected in the course of my PhD research back when.

I'm trying to make it available in the best way possible - both for accessibility and correcting errors.
If you spot data that you believe to be erroneous, please notify me and I may correct it.
